## üéØ Cross-Agent Intelligence Synthesis

### Unified Priority Matrix

| Priority | Issue | Agents Involved | Impact | Effort |
|----------|-------|----------------|--------|--------|
| **P0** | Authentication testing gap | Testing | Critical | Medium |
| **P0** | Fix primary color scheme | UI | High | Low |
| **P1** | Expand nutrition database | Nutrition | High | Medium |
| **P1** | API integration tests | Testing | High | High |
| **P2** | Age-specific scoring | Nutrition | Medium | Medium |
| **P2** | Accessibility testing | Testing, UI | Medium | Medium |
| **P3** | Gamification features | Nutrition | Medium | High |

### Collaborative Insights

1. **Testing √ó Nutrition**: The testing agent confirms that nutrition scoring logic is well-tested, but the nutrition agent identifies algorithmic improvements that would require test updates.

2. **UI √ó Testing**: UI agent found design compliance issues that testing agent's visual regression tests should catch once properly configured.

3. **Nutrition √ó UI**: Nutrition agent's gamification suggestions align with UI agent's modern design capabilities.
