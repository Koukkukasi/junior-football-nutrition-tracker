## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
**Database Performance**: Start with simple queries, optimize later
**Mobile Performance**: Use React best practices, minimize bundle size
**Authentication Complexity**: Use proven service (Clerk) rather than custom

### User Experience Risks
**Too Complex**: Keep MVP extremely simple, add complexity iteratively
**Poor Mobile Experience**: Mobile-first development approach
**Low User Adoption**: Focus on coach-driven adoption initially

### Timeline Risks
**Feature Creep**: Strict adherence to defined MVP scope
**Technical Blockers**: Simple technology choices, proven patterns
**Integration Issues**: Build incrementally with frequent testing

This prototype scope provides a clear, achievable foundation that demonstrates the core value proposition while establishing a solid base for future feature development.
