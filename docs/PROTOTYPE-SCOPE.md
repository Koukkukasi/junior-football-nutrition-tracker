    contingency: "Optimize queries, add caching layer"
  },
  
  mobileResponsiveness: {
    risk: "Poor mobile experience affects adoption",
    mitigation: "Mobile-first development, test on real devices",
    contingency: "Dedicated mobile app development"
  },
  
  authenticationComplexity: {
    risk: "JWT implementation becomes complex",
    mitigation: "Use established authentication library",
    contingency: "Integrate third-party auth service (Auth0, Clerk)"
  }
}
```

### Product Risks
```typescript
interface ProductRisks {
  userAdoption: {
    risk: "Young athletes don't engage with nutrition tracking",
    mitigation: "Simple interface, gamification elements, coach encouragement",
    validation: "User testing with real junior players"
  },
  
  coachBuyIn: {
    risk: "Coaches don't see value in digital tool",
    mitigation: "Clear coach benefits, simple dashboard, time-saving features",
    validation: "Coach interviews and feedback sessions"
  },
  
  featureComplexity: {
